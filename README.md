# TypeScript Erasable Codemod

Hi! This is `tsec`, the codemod tool for automatically migrating your code to be
compatible with TypeScript's
[erasableSyntaxOnly](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#erasableSyntaxOnly)
flag.

The assumptions and opinions related to the changes that will be made are
described in [assumptions.md](./docs/assumptions.md).
